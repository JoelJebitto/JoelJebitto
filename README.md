## 🎓 About Me  
Hi there! I'm Joel, a 10th-grade student at Spartan International School in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. I'm an enthusiastic and self-motivated learner who loves exploring the world of software development. I believe in learning by building, and I’m always excited to dive into new technologies and frameworks.

Outside the classroom, I spend my time building apps, learning backend development, and customizing my developer environment. I’m currently focused on sharpening my full-stack development skills with a strong emphasis on clean, maintainable code.

## 💻 Programming Interests  
- **Languages & Frameworks:**  
  Java, C++, Python, Spring Boot, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ROS 2  
- **Tools & Setup:**  
  AstroNvim (my preferred Neovim setup), Git, GitHub, Linux  
- **What I Like to Build:**  
  - Web applications with dynamic frontends and RESTful backends  
  - Android utilities and experiments  
  - Robotics and automation projects using ROS 2  
  - Backend logic with Spring Boot and efficient APIs  
- **Learning Goals:**  
  - Become proficient in building full-stack Java-based applications  
  - Deepen my understanding of robotics systems with ROS 2  
  - Contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers  

## 📁 Current Focus  
- Learning Spring Boot for backend services  
- Exploring ROS 2 for robotics programming  
- Building full-stack apps using Java + Next.js + Tailwind CSS  
- Customizing my developer workflow using Neovim and CLI tools  

## 📌 Fun Fact  
I use **AstroNvim** as my main Neovim configuration—it’s fast, clean, and helps me stay focused while coding.
